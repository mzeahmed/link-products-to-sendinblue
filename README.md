# Link Products To Sendinblue Lists From WooCommerce

Synchronize your WooCommerce customers with your Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) contact lists — automatically and conditionally.

This plugin lets you assign one or more Brevo contact lists to each WooCommerce product or variation. Once an order is completed, the buyer
is automatically added to the corresponding list(s) — allowing you to run targeted marketing campaigns based on what they actually purchase.

You can also define smart rules (e.g., product price, user role) to fine-tune which customers go into which lists.
